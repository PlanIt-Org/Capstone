## Project Overview

PlanIt is an all-in-one platform designed to simplify planning hangouts, trips, and events. Instead of juggling multiple apps for navigation, transport, and group coordination, PlanIt brings everything together in a single, user-friendly interface. Users can choose locations on a map, generate optimized routes with real-time data, personalize travel options, and invite friends with a shareable link.
