# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Moosay Hailewold, Josh Cesar Pierre, Thomas Sibilly**

## Problem Statement

Planning a hangout, trip or other event can be complex, often requiring multiple apps for navigation, transport, weather, and location info.

## Description

Our all-in-one planner streamlines this by integrating these tools into a single, user-friendly platform. Users simply drop pins on a map, and the app generates optimized routes with real-time data and personalized travel options. The event can then be sent as a link to friends as an invite so they can view the itinerary and choose to go or not.

## Expected Features List

- Account creation
- Create Trip with location
- Sending event links with basic information
- User permissions for events
- User decision trees and voting
- User profiles
