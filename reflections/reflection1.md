## Reflection Questions

### What was at least one successful thing this week?

* Implemented Google Maps into two pages.
* Set up the UI for most of the application.
* Got the Clerk login mostly operational.

---

### What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

* Staying focused
* Keeping track of Trello cards
* Resolving branching issues

---

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week?

We did not finish all of our planned tasks because we over-planned for the week. We will prioritize the remaining tasks by either completing them first thing on Monday or by refactoring the sprint backlog to be more comprehensive.

---

### Did the provided resources help you plan and execute your sprint?

Yes, the resources were helpful. Trello has been a huge help for organization, and learning more about the Scrum framework was very useful. We also found GitHub Actions to be a valuable tool.

---

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”?

The **AI features** are potentially at risk since we're currently behind on our MVP goals. If these items remain at risk, we will need to adjust our plan, possibly by pushing them to a later sprint to ensure the core MVP is completed.
