## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

  - Implemented Google Maps into two pages.
  - Set up UI for most of the application.
  - Clerk login mostly operational.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

  - Staying focused
  - Keeping track of Trello cards
  - Branching issues

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We will prioritize the remanining tasks on the list by getting them done Monday, or refactoring the sprint backlog to be more comprehensive. We overplanned this week, and couldn't get to that goal.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Trello has been a huge help, as well as reading about Scrum. Github Actions has also been useful.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

AI features may be at risk since we're tentatively behind on our MVP goals.
