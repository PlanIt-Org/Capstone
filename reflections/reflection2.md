## Reflection Questions

### What was at least one successful thing this week?

We achieved several key milestones this week:
* Implemented full profile page functionality.
* Deployed an updated landing page.
* Enabled users to generate and share a unique trip link.
* Optimized the frontend by creating custom hooks.
* Integrated basic LLM-powered suggestions.
* Migrated user authentication from Clerk to Supabase.

---

### What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

* Debugging issues that arose from implementing more complex features.
* Managing state became difficult; `useState` was insufficient for some features, requiring us to explore a more robust solution.
* Identifying and refactoring large, inefficient functions in both the frontend and backend.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week?

No, we did not complete everything due to an ambitious sprint plan. However, we successfully completed our Minimum Viable Product (MVP). We have since decided to narrow the scope for our stretch features for next week to ensure they are achievable.

---

### Did the provided resources help you plan and execute your sprint?

Yes, external documentation was critical this week. The resources we found most helpful were the official documentation for React, React Router, Supabase, and the OpenRouter API.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”?

The following features are now considered stretch goals and are at risk of not being completed:
* Advanced AI-powered recommendations
* Calendar export functionality
* Displaying real-time weather conditions
