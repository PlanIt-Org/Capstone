## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.
This week, our team achieved several key successes. We successfully implemented one of our stretch features, [Name of Stretch Feature]. Additionally, we completed the development of the "Save" page functionality and integrated a Discord webhook for notifications.



* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?
  
Our primary challenge this week was a technical issue with the OAuth library, which was not functioning as expected and required significant debugging. We also encountered a persistent bug where a newly implemented feature [mention the specific feature, e.g., "the user profile update"] would not work correctly, forcing us to spend extra time troubleshooting the root cause.


* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We completed the majority of our planned tasks for this sprint. The primary tasks that remain unfinished are the mobile-responsive layout and the final UI design enhancements. We made a strategic decision to prioritize core feature implementation and backend stability over front-end polish.
Another unexpected issue arose when we received charges from the Google Maps API. In response, I proactively researched and identified a cost-effective alternative, Geoapify, which we plan to evaluate for future use.


* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?


Yes, the provided resources were very helpful. Specifically:
  -> The official AI library documentation was essential for implementing our AI-powered feature.
  -> The Google Maps API documentation was crucial for the initial setup and troubleshooting of our location-based services.
  -> The documentation for the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) provided clear guidance that assisted us in building and connecting our application components.


* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The following features are currently considered “at risk” and have been re-categorized as stretch goals:
  -> Push notifications to mobile phones
  -> Calendar export functionality (.ics file)
Our plan is to de-prioritize these features to ensure we deliver a stable and polished core product by the deadline. If we complete all primary objectives ahead of schedule, we will revisit these stretch goals.
